      <h1>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)</h1>
      <p>
        An Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) offers flexibility, contrasting with fixed-rate mortgages where the interest rate remains constant. With an ARM, the interest rate periodically adjusts. Initially, ARM rates are lower than those of fixed-rate mortgages. Therefore, an ARM could be advantageous if you plan to own your home for a limited duration, anticipate future income growth, or find fixed mortgage rates prohibitively high.
