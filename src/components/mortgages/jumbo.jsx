      <h1>About Jumbo Home Loans</h1>
      <p>
        A jumbo loan is a loan that exceeds the conforming loan limits as set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As of 2022, the limit is $647,200 for most of the US, apart from Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the limit is $970,800. Rates tend to be a bit higher on jumbo loans because lenders generally have a higher risk.
